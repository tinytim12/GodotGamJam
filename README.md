Key ideas compiled from chat of BurntRobot, Bernkastel

Generation building.
Like: you make a parents.
and each turn you have a new generation.

I mean: first - you are alone.
second - you get a child and make his way
Ah! So it can mimic you growing up
And step by step - and he's helping you

First level: You are adult, he is child. You jump and make it to the next level but he cant.
Second level: You are adult, he is teenager. Now he can jump and make it 
Three level. You are adult, he is teenager. There are spikes in the map now. He can now jump higher than you and can reach the switch to turn off the spikes
